# Multithreading-Concurrency-Performance-Optimization

This course focuses Multithreading, Concurrency & Parallel programming in Java, with strong emphasis on high performance.
This course was a true rollercoaster, a fascinating journey among the multithreading mesmerising concepts.
From my point of view, multithreading is probably one of the best things from the programming world.

I have added in each folder the exercises for different sections of the course.
