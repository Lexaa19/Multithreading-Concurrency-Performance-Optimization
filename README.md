# Multithreading-Concurrency-Performance-Optimization

This course focuses Multithreading, Concurrency & Parallel programming in Java, with strong emphasis on high performance.
This course was a true rollercoaster, a fascinating journey among the multithreading mesmerising concepts.
From my point of view, multithreading is probably one of the best things from the programming world.

I have added in each folder the exercises for different sections of the course.

Below is the certification from Udemy.

PS: Although not related, unfortunately I haven't saved the work I have done for the Design Patterns Course on Udemy.
However, I still attach the Udemy certification, which I am very proud of. :-) It was the beginning of my journey in the programming world.
